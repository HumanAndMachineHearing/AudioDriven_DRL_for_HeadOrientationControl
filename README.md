# Audio-Driven Deep Reinforcement Learning for Head Orientation Control in Naturalistic Environments

This repository provides an implementation of a reinforcement learning framework utilising deep q learning and a recurrent neural network for audio-driven head orientation control. The framework is described in detail in our paper: 

Ledder, W., Qin, Y., & van der Heijden, K. (2024). Audio-Driven Reinforcement Learning for Head-Orientation in Naturalistic Environments. arXiv preprint arXiv:2409.10048.
